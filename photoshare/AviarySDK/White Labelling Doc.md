# Aviary White Labeling
Included with this document is a file with an `avyPermission` extension. To enable white labeling for your application, you will need to include this file in your App's main bundle. Adding the file to your Xcode project should do this automatically.
NOTE: This file is tied to your App's API key and will not work for any other applications.
